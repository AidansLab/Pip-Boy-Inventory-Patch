## How to use:
1. Download this GitHub repository and extract it, inside are all the files you will need to get started.
2. Move **minified-invPatch_V1.1.js** to USER_BOOT on your Pip-Boy 3000 MK V either by taking out the SD card and moving it over, or by uploading it with the [Pip-Boy mainatanance tool](https://pip-boy.com/3000-mk-v/maintenance).
3. Provided in the DATA folder are a prebuilt items list, some sounds, and a few images. Move all of these into the DATA folder on your Pip-Boy (create it if it does not already exist by putting DATA in the "Upload to a custom directory" box in the upload section of the maintanance tool).<BR/>
   Optional: If you wish to modify your inventory, use the HTML tool provided [here](https://github.com/AidanLeeCalamera/Pip-Boy-Inventory-JSON-Generator/tree/main).
4. Enjoy your inventory, and stock up on Stimpaks and RadAway!

# Known Issues!
1. Pip UI+ is a very finicky, and may or may not work for you. I suggest setting your Pip UI+ settings before installing this patch.
2. Custom Radio is extremely laggy and unstable. A custom version with the waveform removed has been included to replace your existing one. Simply delete customradio.min.js from USER/CUSTOM_RADIO, and replace it with the included one.</BR>
# Roadmap
1. Item viewer with description.
2. Weapon and Apparel stat compare.
